## File descriptions
1.EmissionEstimation_Trajectorylevel.py: codes for trajectory-level emission estimation in the TrackATruck model. Lines 1-13 of the code run the import of the dependent python libraries. Lines 15-24 run the process of importing the underlying data involving the basic parameters of the model. Lines 26-158 are the main program that contains the processing of the GPS trajectory data and the emission estimation process.
2.GPA_Data.rar: the test data, including GPS trajectory data from three heavy-duty trucks(HDTs) over a three-day period (July 11 to July 13, 2016).The license plate information of the HDTs has been encrypted due to the data privacy information involved.
